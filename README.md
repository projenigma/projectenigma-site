# Hi there, welcome!

## Our Objective

Project Enigma aims to employ mechanical puzzles and science toys towards improving the lives of vulnerable communities, namely the elderly and disadvantaged teens in Singapore.

## Our Approach

We plan to do this by bringing the toys closer to the communities through a library-like system, loaning out kits to individuals and organizations. Curiosities will be carefully selected, arranged and offered at an affordable cost. The items that we offer will also be hand-held, portable and durable.

## Potential Impacts
- Develop better focus and memory, delay onset of dementia among the elderly
- Spark curiosity in Science and related fields among youth
- Derive satisfaction from solving a puzzle & boost self-esteem and confidence
- Hone critical thinking and problem solving skills
- Promote self-directed learning and discovery
- Train visual and spatial reasoning
- Bond with family and friends & relieve stress
- Alternative for video games or outdoor activities
- Simplify complex phenomena
- And more!
